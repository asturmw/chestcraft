# chestcraft

Rust file-sharing app for a home NAS: browse, upload, share links, WebDAV, and an admin
dashboard with ZFS/SMART health and Telegram alerts. Replaces copyparty.

@deploy/site/CLAUDE.site.md

## Status

Plan steps 1–2 done (skeleton, `docs/ui-handoff.md`, rustup stable + musl target). Step 3,
slice 1 done: config schema + validation (`chestcraft check`), `RelPath`, permissions, 29
tests. Next: slice 2, browse/download/zip.

## Rules

- **Pure Rust:** pure-Rust crates only. The release build must pass with
  `CC=/bin/false CXX=/bin/false` (any crate that compiles C fails it). External programs
  run only as subprocesses, by absolute path: `/usr/sbin/zpool`, `/usr/sbin/zfs`,
  `/usr/sbin/smartctl`, `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`, `/usr/bin/curl` (Telegram; token on stdin, never
  in argv).
- **UI:** `design/` belongs to the design session (branch `design`, worktree
  `../chestcraft-design`). Don't edit it on `main`; integrate from it. Contract:
  `docs/ui-handoff.md` section 5 and `design/NOTES.md`.
- **Public-ready repo:** no secrets; no real hostnames, IPs, users or paths outside
  `deploy/site/` (gitignored). Tests and fixtures use fictional data; anonymize disk serials.
- **Deletion:** user files are deleted only by the trash purge (`trash_days`) and by the
  cleanup of abandoned `.part` uploads. No other code path deletes or overwrites user files;
  replacing a file moves the old one to the trash first (WebDAV PUT/MOVE are the exception).
- **Install:** the binary on the server is root-owned because the root SMART collector runs
  it. It must never be writable by the service user.
- Commit only when asked.

## Layout (planned)

- `src/`: `config/`, `db/` (redb), `auth/`, `fs/` (paths, trash, upload, zip, thumbs),
  `web/` (axum routes, maud views), `dav/`, `shares/`, `health/` (zpool, zfs, smart, mdstat,
  host, history, alerts), `notify/`, `i18n.rs`
- `assets/`: CSS, JS, fonts, icons (integrated from `design/`)
- `i18n/`: `de.toml`, `en.toml` (a missing key fails the tests)
- `deploy/`: `release.sh`, `install.sh`, `units/`, `site/` (gitignored)
- `tests/`, `fixtures/`: integration tests; zpool/zfs/smartctl JSON samples
- `config.example.toml`: config schema (draft)

## Build and test (once the toolchain is installed)

- `cargo test`
- `deploy/release.sh`: fmt, clippy, tests, C-free static musl release build
